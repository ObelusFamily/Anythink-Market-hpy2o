## First setup

**[TODO 05/01/2018 @vanessa-cooper]:** _It's been a while since anyone ran a fresh copy of this repo. I think it's worth documenting the steps needed to install and run the repo on a new machine?_

<!---- Instructions to Set Up Local Docker Environment --->

Step 1: Install Docker by clicking on the link provided by Ness.
        Note - While installing Docker, there is a certain version of Win 10 required for Docker installation. If the installation does not go through, update your Windows from Windows Update or Microsoft website

Step 2: After installing Docker, then the command given by Ness should 
        be executed in the backend and frontend of the project root     directory. If all things are fine, the output will come as expected.
